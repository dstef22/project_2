# project_2

Final Project 2: Wordpy.
        Using code from an old lab I am creating a wordle game with a gui.
TODO: I plan on making an executable for this file,
        and I plan on making a way to switch between which file the word comes from,
        and I plan on showing which letters have benn guessed already.
        and I plan on making a way to restart the game in the gui.
