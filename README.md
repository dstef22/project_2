Final Project 2: Wordpy.
        Using code from an old lab I am creating a wordle game with a gui.
        Using code from an old lab I am creating a wordle game with a gui.
        You are able to switch which list the word to guess is pulled from.
        You can restart the game to guess a different word from the list.
        Word lists were made using a separate script I created called word_file_maker.py.
        
        TODO: I plan on making an executable for this file
